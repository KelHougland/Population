# This is where we make the individuals in the villages grow with each generation
# I need five classes individuals, villages, buildings, outsiders, and players
        
       

        # players must have names, login information, an associated village, angels, and god power

## TODO: Allow players to choose angels from population each gen, add gen tracker on indviduals, figure out how to use souls for things and delete them from the log
    ##: create lesson data base and figure out how to keep track of what lesson's a player has access to in their buildings, add max lessons and indv to building per level
